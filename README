# Agri-Tech Drone Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates an agri-tech drone system for monitoring plant health. It uses a microservices architecture implemented in a Nx monorepo, featuring drone simulation, real-time data processing, and a web client for visualization.

## Features

- Drone simulation with realistic movement and battery depletion
- Plant health monitoring
- Real-time data transmission using MQTT
- RESTful API for data retrieval
- Web client for data visualization
